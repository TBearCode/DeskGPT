This is a file management application based on UNIX that enables a higher level of abstraction for processes that are typically quite verbose and complex.
This software by no means covers all UNIX functionalities and is not intended as a replacement for UNIX, but instead offers a low barrier to entry for file management.
In other words, this software's intended use is to allow the UNIX-uninitiated to access its functionality in multiple, but not all, use cases.

While the naming of this program remains comedic for the time being, should time allow, I would try to enable NLP for parsing variable text input from the user into executable commands.

Pending Functionality:
    Display - A user friendly UI for navigating file systems (visualize file trees and arrow between them)
    Write: Macro - Allow the user define their own commands using the ones provided in this download
    Help - Explain the commands available to the user through this software
    Sort - Sort files
    DevTools : Document - Read through a program file and document blocks (start, end, name)
